## My custom NeoVim configurations

### My configurations include
- GigaChad base configuration
- leader key changed to `f`
- `fso` to look at file objects
- preview functions
  - `gpd` for previewing function definitions
  - `gpr` for previewing function references
  - `gpi` for previewing implementation
  - `gP` for closing the preview window
- Also includes file structure search using `fff`
` I plan to continously add more until satisfied.
